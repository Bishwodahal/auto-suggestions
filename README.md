Checks if these characters are same or not  (case insensitive)

ðŸ§¿Function: `display(.....)`

It is just for displaying datas. There is not any default way to display vectors and others in C++, So used in these only

## Main Algorithm

If the word is found then just message is displayed and 
If the word is not found 

* It removes all words whose length doesnot match witinput text
* Loops till the length of input string 
    * Removes words whose current character does not matches
    * If the suggestions is empty , we increase the counter in for loop because currently is already calculated.
    * if the character at current exist then removing words whose current character doesnot matches character at all elements
    * If the suggestions is empty then assigining suggestions to previousSuggestions and breaking it.
* At last just removing more items. If it's size igreater than 5, then it checks for first element
* Just making the array exactly 5
